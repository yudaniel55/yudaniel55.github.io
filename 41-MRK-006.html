<div class="c-drop">6</div> <span class="v">1</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he went away from there, and came into his country; and his disciples went with him. <span id="bookmarks1"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_01-03.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v2"></a><span class="v">2</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And when the Sabbath day had come, he was teaching in the Synagogue; and a number of people hearing him were surprised, saying, From where did this man get these things? and, What is the wisdom given to this man, and what are these works of power done by his hands? <span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a><span class="v">3</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>Is not this the woodworker, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were bitter against him. <span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a><span class="v">4</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to them, A prophet is nowhere without honour, but in his country, and among his relations, and in his family. <span id="bookmarks4"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_04-06.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v5"></a><span class="v">5</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he was unable to do any work of power there, but only to put his hands on one or two persons who were ill, and make them well. <span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a><span class="v">6</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he was greatly surprised because they had no faith. And he went about the country places teaching. <span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a><span class="v">7</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he gave orders to the twelve, and sent them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits; <span id="bookmarks7"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_07-09.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v8"></a><span class="v">8</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he said that they were to take nothing for their journey, but a stick only; no bread, no bag, no money in their pockets; <span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a><span class="v">9</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>They were to go with common shoes on their feet, and not to take two coats. <span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a><span class="v">10</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Wherever you go into a house, make that your resting-place till you go away. <span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a><span class="v">11</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And whatever place will not take you in and will not give ear to you, when you go away, put off the dust from your feet as a witness against them. <span id="bookmarks11"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_10-11.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v12"></a><span class="v">12</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And they went out, preaching the need for a change of heart in men. <span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a><span class="v">13</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And they sent out a number of evil spirits, and put oil on a great number who were ill, and made them well. <span id="bookmarks13"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_12-13.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v14"></a><span class="v">14</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And king Herod had news of him, because his name was on the lips of all; and he said, John the Baptist has come back from the dead, and for this reason these powers are working in him. <span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a><span class="v">15</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>But others said, It is Elijah. And others said, It is a prophet, even like one of the prophets. <span id="bookmarks15"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_14-15.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v16"></a><span class="v">16</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>But Herod, when he had news of it, said, John, whom I put to death, has come back from the dead. <span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a><span class="v">17</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>For Herod himself had sent men out to take John and put him in prison, because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had taken for himself. <span id="bookmarks17"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_16-17.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v18"></a><span class="v">18</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>For John said to Herod, It is wrong for you to have your brother's wife. <span id="bookmarks18"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_18-20.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v19"></a><span class="v">19</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And Herodias was bitter against him, desiring to put him to death; but she was not able; <span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a><span class="v">20</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>For Herod was in fear of John, being conscious that he was an upright and holy man, and kept him safe. And hearing him, he was much troubled; and he gave ear to him gladly. <span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a><span class="v">21</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And the chance came when Herod on his birthday gave a feast to his lords, and the high captains, and the chief men of Galilee; <span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a><span class="v">22</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and did a dance, Herod and those who were at table with him were pleased with her; and the king said to the girl, Make a request for anything and I will give it you. <span id="bookmarks22"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_21-23.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v23"></a><span class="v">23</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he took an oath, saying to her, Whatever is your desire I will give it to you, even half of my kingdom. <span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a><span class="v">24</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And she went out and said to her mother, What is my request to be? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. <span id="bookmarks24"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_24.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v25"></a><span class="v">25</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And she came in quickly to the king, and said, My desire is that you give me straight away on a plate the head of John the Baptist. <span id="bookmarks25"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_25.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v26"></a><span class="v">26</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And the king was very sad; but because of his oaths, and those who were with him at table, he would not say 'No' to her. <span id="bookmarks26"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_26-27.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v27"></a><span class="v">27</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And straight away the king sent out one of his armed men, and gave him an order to come back with the head: and he went and took off John's head in prison, <span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v28"></a><span class="v">28</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And came back with the head on a plate, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother. <span id="bookmarks28"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_28-29.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v29"></a><span class="v">29</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And when his disciples had news of it, they came and took up his body, and put it in its last resting-place. <span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a><span class="v">30</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And the twelve came together to Jesus; and they gave him an account of all the things they had done, and all they had been teaching. <span id="bookmarks30"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_30-31a.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v31"></a><span class="v">31</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Come away by yourselves to a quiet place, and take a rest for a time. Because there were a great number coming and going, and they had no time even for food. <span id="bookmarks31"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_31b-33.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v32"></a><span class="v">32</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And they went away in the boat to a waste place by themselves. <span id="bookmarks32"></span> <a id="v33"></a><span class="v">33</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And the people saw them going, and a number of them, having knowledge who they were, went running there together on foot from all the towns, and got there before them. <span id="bookmarks33"></span> <a id="v34"></a><span class="v">34</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he got out, and saw a great mass of people, and he had pity on them, because they were like sheep without a keeper: and he gave them teaching about a number of things. <span id="bookmarks34"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_34-37.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v35"></a><span class="v">35</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And at the end of the day, his disciples came to him and said, This place is waste land, and it is late: <span id="bookmarks35"></span> <a id="v36"></a><span class="v">36</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>Send them away, so that they may go into the country and small towns round about, and get some food for themselves. <span id="bookmarks36"></span> <a id="v37"></a><span class="v">37</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>But he said to them in answer, Give them food yourselves. And they said to him, Are we to go and get bread for two hundred pence, and give it to them? <span id="bookmarks37"></span> <a id="v38"></a><span class="v">38</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, How much bread have you? go and see. And when they had seen, they said, Five cakes of bread and two fishes. <span id="bookmarks38"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_38.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v39"></a><span class="v">39</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he made them all be seated in groups on the green grass. <span id="bookmarks39"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_39-40.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v40"></a><span class="v">40</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And they were placed in groups, by hundreds and by fifties. <span id="bookmarks40"></span> <a id="v41"></a><span class="v">41</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and, looking up to heaven, he said words of blessing over them; and when the cakes were broken, he gave them to the disciples to put before the people; and he made division of the two fishes among them all. <span id="bookmarks41"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_41.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v42"></a><span class="v">42</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And they all took of the food and had enough. <span id="bookmarks42"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_42.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v43"></a><span class="v">43</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken bits and of the fishes. <span id="bookmarks43"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_43-44.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v44"></a><span class="v">44</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And those who took of the bread were five thousand men. <span id="bookmarks44"></span> <a id="v45"></a><span class="v">45</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And straight away he made his disciples get into the boat, and go before him to the other side to Beth-saida, while he himself sent the people away. <span id="bookmarks45"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_45.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v46"></a><span class="v">46</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And after he had sent them away, he went up into a mountain for prayer. <span id="bookmarks46"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_46.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v47"></a><span class="v">47</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And by evening, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he by himself on the land. <span id="bookmarks47"></span> <a id="v48"></a><span class="v">48</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And seeing that they had trouble in getting their boat through the water, because the wind was against them, about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea; and he would have gone past them; <span id="bookmarks48"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_47-48.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v49"></a><span class="v">49</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>But they, when they saw him walking on the sea, took him for a spirit, and gave a loud cry: <span id="bookmarks49"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_49-52.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v50"></a><span class="v">50</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>For they all saw him, and were troubled. But straight away he said to them, Take heart, it is I, have no fear. <span id="bookmarks50"></span> <a id="v51"></a><span class="v">51</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he went to them into the boat, and the wind went down, and they were full of wonder in themselves; <span id="bookmarks51"></span> <a id="v52"></a><span class="v">52</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>For it was not clear to them about the bread; but their hearts were hard. <span id="bookmarks52"></span> <a id="v53"></a><span class="v">53</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And when they had gone across, they came to Gennesaret, and got their boat to land. <span id="bookmarks53"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_53-55.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v54"></a><span class="v">54</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And when they had got out of the boat, the people quickly had news of him, <span id="bookmarks54"></span> <a id="v55"></a><span class="v">55</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And went running through all the country round about, and took on their beds those who were ill, to where it was said that he was. <span id="bookmarks55"></span> <a id="v56"></a><span class="v">56</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And wherever he went, into small towns, or great towns, or into the country, they took those who were ill into the market-places, requesting him that they might put their hands even on the edge of his robe: and all those who did so were made well. <span id="bookmarks56"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark06_56.jpg" /></span></div>

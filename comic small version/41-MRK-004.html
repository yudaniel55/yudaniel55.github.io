<div class="p"> <a id="v2"></a><span class="v">2</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he taught them many <span class="add">things</span> by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine, <span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a><span class="v">3</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow: <span id="bookmarks3"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark04_03.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v4"></a><span class="v">4</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>and it came to pass, as <span class="add">he</span> sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up. <span id="bookmarks4"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark04_04.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v5"></a><span class="v">5</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because <span class="add">it</span> had no depth of earth: <span id="bookmarks5"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark04_05-06.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v6"></a><span class="v">6</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>but when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because <span class="add">it</span> had no root, it withered away. <span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a><span class="v">7</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. <span id="bookmarks7"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark04_07.jpg" /></span></div>

<div class="p"><span class="v">10</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable. <span id="bookmarks10"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark04_10-12.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v11"></a><span class="v">11</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all <span class="add">these things</span> are done in parables: <span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a><span class="v">12</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and <span class="add">their</span> sins should be forgiven them. <span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a><span class="v">13</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how <span class="add">then</span> will you know all parables? <span id="bookmarks13"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark04_13-20.jpg" /></span></div>

<div class="p"><span class="v">21</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? <span class="add">and</span> not to be set on a candlestick? <span id="bookmarks21"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark04_21-23.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v22"></a><span class="v">22</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was <span class="add">any thing</span> kept secret, but that it should come abroad. <span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a><span class="v">23</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>If any <span class="add">man</span> have ears to hear, let him hear. <span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a><span class="v">24</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Take heed what you hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given. <span id="bookmarks24"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark04_24-25.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v25"></a><span class="v">25</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even <span class="add">that</span> which he hath. <span id="bookmarks25"></span></div><span id="bookmarks25"></span><a id="v26"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">26</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground, <span id="bookmarks26"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark04_26.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v27"></a><span class="v">27</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. <span id="bookmarks27"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark04_27.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v28"></a><span class="v">28</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear. <span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a><span class="v">29</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come. <span id="bookmarks29"></span></div><span id="bookmarks29"></span><a id="v30"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">30</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it? <span id="bookmarks30"></span> <a id="v31"></a><span class="v">31</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span><span class="add">It is</span> like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth: <span id="bookmarks31"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark04_31.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v32"></a><span class="v">32</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>but when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it. <span id="bookmarks32"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark04_32-34.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v33"></a><span class="v">33</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear <span class="add">it</span>. <span id="bookmarks33"></span> <a id="v34"></a><span class="v">34</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>But without a parable spake he not unto them: and <span class="add">when they were</span> alone, he expounded all <span class="add">things</span> to his disciples. <span id="bookmarks34"></span></div><span id="bookmarks34"></span><a id="v35"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">35</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side. <span id="bookmarks35"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark04_35a.jpg" /></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark04_35b.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v36"></a><span class="v">36</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him <span class="add">even</span> as he was in the ship.

<div class="p"> <a id="v37"></a><span class="v">37</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. <span id="bookmarks37"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark04_37.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v38"></a><span class="v">38</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? <span id="bookmarks38"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark04_38a.jpg" /></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark04_38b.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v39"></a><span class="v">39</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still.

<div class="p"> <a id="v2"></a><span class="v">2</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive <span class="add">them</span>, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them. <span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a><span class="v">3</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, <span class="add">which was</span> borne of four. <span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a><span class="v">4</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken <span class="add">it</span> up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. <span id="bookmarks4"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark02_04.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v5"></a><span class="v">5</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. <span id="bookmarks5"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark02_05.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v6"></a><span class="v">6</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, <span id="bookmarks6"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark02_06-07.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v7"></a><span class="v">7</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>Why doth this <span class="add">man</span> thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only? <span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a><span class="v">8</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And immediately, when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these <span class="add">things</span> in your hearts? <span id="bookmarks8"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark02_08-11.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v9"></a><span class="v">9</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, <span class="add">Thy</span> sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk? <span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a><span class="v">10</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) <span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a><span class="v">11</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house. <span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a><span class="v">12</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before <span class="add">them</span> all; insomuch that <span class="add">they</span> were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw <span class="add">it</span> on this fashion. <span id="bookmarks12"></span></div><span id="bookmarks12"></span><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark02_12.jpg" /></span></div><a id="v13"></a>

<div class="p"> <a id="v19"></a><span class="v">19</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. <span id="bookmarks19"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark02_19-20.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v20"></a><span class="v">20</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days. <span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a><span class="v">21</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>No <span class="add">man</span> also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away <span class="add">from</span> the old, and the rent is made worse. <span id="bookmarks21"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark02_21a.jpg" /></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark02_21b.jpg" /></span></div>

<div class="p"> <a id="v24"></a><span class="v">24</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day <span class="add">that</span> which is not lawful? <span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a><span class="v">25</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was a hungred, he, and they <span class="add">that were</span> with him? <span id="bookmarks25"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark02_25-28.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v26"></a><span class="v">26</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? <span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a><span class="v">27</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, <span class="add">and</span> not man for the sabbath: <span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v28"></a><span class="v">28</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. <span id="bookmarks28"></span></div>

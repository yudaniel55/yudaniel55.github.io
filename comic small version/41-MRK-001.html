<div class="p"> <a id="v2"></a><span class="v">2</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>as it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. <span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a><span class="v">3</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. <span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a><span class="v">4</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. <span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a><span class="v">5</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And there went out unto him all the land of Judea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river <span class="add">of</span> Jordan, confessing their sins. <span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a><span class="v">6</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; <span id="bookmarks6"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_06-08.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v7"></a><span class="v">7</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>and preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. <span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a><span class="v">8</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. <span id="bookmarks8"></span></div><span id="bookmarks8"></span><a id="v9"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">9</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in those days, <span class="add">that</span> Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. <span id="bookmarks9"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_09-10a.jpg" /></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_09-10b.jpg" /></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_09-10c.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v10"></a><span class="v">10</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: <span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a><span class="v">11</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>and there came a voice from heaven, <span class="add">saying</span>, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. <span id="bookmarks11"></span></div><span id="bookmarks11"></span><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_11.jpg" /></span></div><a id="v12"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">12</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness. <span id="bookmarks12"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_12.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v13"></a><span class="v">13</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him. <span id="bookmarks13"></span></div><span id="bookmarks13"></span><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_13a.jpg" /></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_13b.jpg" /></span></div><a id="v14"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">14</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, <span id="bookmarks14"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_14-15.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v15"></a><span class="v">15</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. <span id="bookmarks15"></span></div><span id="bookmarks15"></span><a id="v16"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">16</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. <span id="bookmarks16"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_16.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v17"></a><span class="v">17</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. <span id="bookmarks17"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_17-20.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v18"></a><span class="v">18</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him. <span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a><span class="v">19</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the <span class="add">son</span> of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also <span class="add">were</span> in the ship mending <span class="add">their</span> nets. <span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a><span class="v">20</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him. <span id="bookmarks20"></span></div><span id="bookmarks20"></span><a id="v21"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">21</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught. <span id="bookmarks21"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_21-22.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v22"></a><span class="v">22</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as <span class="add">one</span> that had authority, and not as the scribes. <span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a><span class="v">23</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, <span id="bookmarks23"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_23-24.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v24"></a><span class="v">24</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>saying, Let <span class="add">us</span> alone; what have we to do with thee, <span class="add">thou</span> Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. <span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a><span class="v">25</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. <span id="bookmarks25"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_25.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v26"></a><span class="v">26</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. <span id="bookmarks26"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_26.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v27"></a><span class="v">27</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And they were all amazed, insomuch that <span class="add">they</span> questioned among themselves, saying, What <span class="add">thing</span> is this? what new doctrine <span class="add">is</span> this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him. <span id="bookmarks27"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_27-28.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v28"></a><span class="v">28</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee. <span id="bookmarks28"></span></div><span id="bookmarks28"></span><a id="v29"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">29</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. <span id="bookmarks29"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_29-31.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v30"></a><span class="v">30</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her. <span id="bookmarks30"></span> <a id="v31"></a><span class="v">31</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he came and took her by the hand, and lift her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them. <span id="bookmarks31"></span> <a id="v32"></a><span class="v">32</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils. <span id="bookmarks32"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_32-34.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v33"></a><span class="v">33</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And all the city was gathered together at the door. <span id="bookmarks33"></span> <a id="v34"></a><span class="v">34</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he healed many <span class="add">that were</span> sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him. <span id="bookmarks34"></span></div><span id="bookmarks34"></span><a id="v35"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">35</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. <span id="bookmarks35"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_35.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v36"></a><span class="v">36</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him. <span id="bookmarks36"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_36-37.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v37"></a><span class="v">37</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And when they had found him, they said unto him, All <span class="add">men</span> seek for thee. <span id="bookmarks37"></span> <a id="v38"></a><span class="v">38</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth. <span id="bookmarks38"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_38-39.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v39"></a><span class="v">39</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils. <span id="bookmarks39"></span></div><span id="bookmarks39"></span><a id="v40"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">40</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. <span id="bookmarks40"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_40-41.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v41"></a><span class="v">41</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth <span class="add">his</span> hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean. <span id="bookmarks41"></span> <a id="v42"></a><span class="v">42</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed. <span id="bookmarks42"></span></div><div class="image-block"><span class="image"><img src="images/Mark01_42-45.jpg" /></span></div>
<div class="p"> <a id="v43"></a><span class="v">43</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; <span id="bookmarks43"></span> <a id="v44"></a><span class="v">44</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any <span class="add">man:</span> but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing <span class="add">those things</span> which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. <span id="bookmarks44"></span> <a id="v45"></a><span class="v">45</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>But he went out, and began to publish <span class="add">it</span> much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that <span class="add">Jesus</span> could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter. <span id="bookmarks45"></span></div>
